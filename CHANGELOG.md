# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A view can be exported as a self-contained HTML page that shows the table, timeline and board in any browser
- Other apps on the same computer can read and edit tasks over a local HTTP and MCP server when it is turned on in settings

### Fixed

- The task title was not focused when the task dialog opened ([#303](https://github.com/dotpm/obsidian-pm/issues/303))
- The project name was not focused when the new project dialog opened
- The project name and icon above a view did nothing when activated with the keyboard
- A project or task description was replaced by the entire note when the note's properties could not be read ([#274](https://github.com/dotpm/obsidian-pm/issues/274))
- Properties other plugins added to a note were removed by the next save when the note's properties could not be read

## [2.3.1] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Status, priority, date and tag pickers opened outside the dialog when a theme applied a blur or transform to dialogs ([#276](https://github.com/dotpm/obsidian-pm/issues/276))

## [2.3.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- The shortcut that saves a task and creates a project can be changed between Shift+Enter and Ctrl/Cmd+Enter

### Changed

- The new project dialog creates the project with the save shortcut or its create button

### Fixed

- Undo while typing in a dialog reverted the last task change when a Gantt view was open
- Saving a task or project removed the properties that other plugins or the user had added to its note ([#272](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/272))

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- The timeline has a year zoom level, showing quarters under each year ([#50](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/50), [#77](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/77), [#147](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/147))
- A project can be duplicated with all its tasks, from the project list's context menu or the duplicate project command
- The plugin's entry in Obsidian's plugin list links to the author's funding page

### Changed

- The plugin is now called dotpm, matching the [dotpm](https://dotpm.pm) organization the repository moved to ([#269](https://github.com/dotpm/obsidian-pm/issues/269)). Commands are listed under **dotpm** in the Command Palette instead of **Project Manager**. Existing hotkeys, settings, and task files are unaffected, and updates continue as before.
- Subtasks, parents and dependencies appear in the graph view and in a note's properties as links

### Fixed

- Edits, dependency checks, and archiving could act on the wrong project when one project was created by copying another's folder
- The expand/collapse triangle was hard to click in the table, project list and Gantt views ([#266](https://github.com/dotpm/obsidian-pm/pull/266))
- A task's due date in the table kept only the first digit typed and closed before the rest could be entered

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-27

### Highlights

- **Auto-archive:** Completed tasks move into the project's archive on their own after a number of days you choose, set once for every project or overridden by a project in its own settings, and the archive completed tasks command does the same sweep right away.
- **Inherited custom fields:** Custom fields can be defined once for the whole vault or on a parent project, and every project underneath starts with them. Each project can still rename, retype, or hide a field it inherits, and a field it already had of its own can be merged into the inherited one, values and all.

### Added

- Completed tasks move to the project's archive after the number of days set in the new auto-archive setting ([#204](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/204))
- A project can override the auto-archive window in the project settings
- The archive completed tasks command moves finished tasks into the archive right away
- A sub-project has the custom fields its parent project defines ([#255](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/255))
- Custom fields can be defined for the whole vault, so every project starts with them
- A project can rename, retype, or hide a custom field it inherits, in the project settings
- A custom field that duplicates an inherited one can be merged into it, values and all

### Fixed

- Renaming a project from its settings page left its note and folder named after the old title
- A view failed to load when a note's properties held an invalid value for team members, assignees, tags, or dependencies ([#252](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/252))
- A sub-project or subtask nested two levels deep drew a leftover connector line beside it when its parent was the last of its siblings

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-25

### Highlights

- **Breaking change:** the plugin now requires Obsidian 1.13 or later, so update Obsidian before installing this release.
- **Project overviews:** Opening a project now shows its own page, with progress, description, a milestone timeline, sub-projects, and properties. Plus a new setting that can switch this back to opening straight into the task list. It's up to you.
- **Sub-projects and multi-project views:** Projects can nest under a parent, and the table, board, and timeline can show a project's subtree, its folder, or the whole vault at once, with their own saved views and filters.
- **A folder per project:** Each project now keeps everything together in one folder, and old existing projects migrate to the new structure automatically.
- **Cross-project dependencies:** A task can depend on or block work in another project, with its schedule following the dates of the project it depends on.
- **Custom priorities and per-project config:** Priorities can be added, renamed, recolored, and reordered, and a project can define its own statuses, priorities, default view, and scheduling behavior in its settings
- **Progress and completion timing:** A task's progress can be set directly from 0 to 100, and a completed task shows whether it finished on time or how many days late it was
- **People notes:** Assignees and project members can be linked to the person notes in your vault, with avatars, a note created automatically for a new name, and commands that list everything one person is working on
- **Better wikilinks:** Names, custom fields, and project links written as wikilinks resolve to the note they point to wherever they show up. We all love those nice obsidian graphs!
- **Improved custom fields style:** A custom field now uses the same controls as a task's built-in properties, so a custom date opens the date picker and a custom select shares status's popover, and in the table a link or person field shows as a link or an avatar instead of raw text, and a checkbox renders as a proper checkbox
- **A searchable icon picker:** Status, priority, and project icons are chosen from a grid of every icon Obsidian knows, or set to any emoji
- **Settings rework:** Settings are grouped by area, with statuses, priorities, team members, and TaskNotes each on their own page, and can be found through Obsidian's own settings search.
- **Tasks in tabs:** Tasks can open in a tab instead of a modal, with the task editor hosted as a page of its own
- **TaskNotes import:** Tasks, statuses, and priorities can be imported from TaskNotes, including dates, dependencies, subtasks, tags, and archive state
- **A lighter index behind the scenes:** The project list, pickers, and due-date reminders read from a lightweight index instead of re-parsing every project file, so they stay quick even in very large vaults
- **Updated sync engine:** A task or project open in several tabs or views stays in sync: an edit in one place shows up in all the others right away

### Added

- Assignees and project members can be picked from the person notes already in your vault, so the task links to them and they appear in the graph ([#131](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/131))
- A person with no note yet gets one created from the assignee picker, in the new people folder setting
- Clicking an assignee's avatar opens that person's note
- The show tasks assigned to a person command lists everything one person is working on, across every project
- A person note opened in the editor shows that person's tasks with the show tasks assigned to this note command
- The link assignees to their person notes command turns typed names into links to the notes of the same name
- Opening a project from the project list shows its overview: progress, description, milestones, sub-projects, and properties
- Clicking a project opens its tasks instead of its overview when the open projects in setting is set to tasks
- A row, card, or timeline label naming its project opens that project when clicked
- Projects are listed wherever their files live in the vault
- A project can sit under another one, chosen in the project settings
- The project list nests sub-projects under their parent, whose card counts the tasks of the whole group
- Folders can be left out of the project list with the new excluded folders setting
- The rebuild project index command looks through the vault for projects again
- The table, board, and timeline can show several projects at once, chosen from the switcher next to the project name
- The open all projects command puts every project in the vault in one view
- Rows, cards, and timeline labels name their project when a view covers more than one
- Saved views and filters belong to the set of projects on screen, so a project and its sub-projects keep separate ones
- A task can depend on a task in another project, and its dates follow that one
- The task editor lists the tasks a task blocks, wherever they live
- The task menu moves a task and its subtasks to another project
- A timeline row says when a task depends on something outside the view
- Priorities can be added, renamed, recolored, and reordered in settings
- Priority icons can be switched between chevrons, signal bars, arrows, alerts, or none, globally or per project
- Status and priority icons are picked from a searchable grid of every icon Obsidian knows, or set to an emoji by pasting one into its search field
- A project's icon is picked from that same grid, so it can be any icon Obsidian knows and not only an emoji
- TaskNotes tasks can be imported with their dates, dependencies, subtasks, tags, and archive state ([#16](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/16))
- Statuses and priorities can be imported from TaskNotes in settings ([#16](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/16))
- Projects can define their own statuses and priorities in the project settings, replacing the global ones ([#57](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/57))
- Projects can override the default view, auto-scheduling, and the board display options in the project settings
- The completed date shows whether a task finished on time or how many days late it was
- Task progress can be set from 0 to 100 in the task editor and by clicking the progress bar in the table
- Dependent tasks move earlier when a task is completed before its due date, using the new pull-forward setting ([#154](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/154))
- Tasks open in a tab instead of a modal when the new task opening setting is set to tab
- A task note opens in the task editor when tasks are set to open in a tab
- The task menu moves the task being edited into a tab
- Subtasks in the table are joined to their parent by tree lines, which can be turned off with the new show subtree connections setting
- The table draws lines between rows, between columns, or both, using the new line borders setting

### Changed

- A project keeps its note and its task notes together in a folder of its own
- An existing project moves into its own folder when the vault is opened, keeping its filters, saved views, and open tabs
- A new sub-project is created inside its parent's folder
- Renaming a project note renames the folder it owns, so the two keep matching
- Deleting a project deletes its folder, unless a sub-project sits inside it
- The tags offered in the task editor are listed alphabetically
- Custom fields in the task editor use the same controls as the task's own properties, so a custom date opens the date picker and a custom select the same popover as status
- Project members, the global team members, and task assignees are picked from the same control, which searches the people in your vault and offers to create the note for a new name
- The people a picker offers include the global team members, the project's own members, and everyone already assigned in that project
- A person already picked as a plain name shows as picked when the same person is found as a note
- The project name above the table, timeline, and board opens that project's overview when clicked. Previously it was an editable field for renaming the project

- The project list is a table of rows with progress, task counts, members, and the last due date, replacing the cards
- The project list counts how many projects have tasks past due
- Sub-projects in the project list are joined to their parent by tree lines, which can be turned off with the show subtree connections setting
- The project list draws lines between rows, between columns, or both, following the line borders setting
- Project settings open in a page of their own, keeping each change as it is made
- Creating a project asks for its name, icon, color, parent, members, and description in one dialog
- The new project dialog is laid out like the task editor, with a large name field and a properties grid
- A project's color is chosen from the color picker, replacing the ten preset swatches
- The projects folder setting decides where new projects are created, not which projects the plugin shows
- Table rows have no line between them unless line borders are turned on
- The plugin requires Obsidian 1.13
- Settings are grouped by area, with statuses, priorities, team members, and TaskNotes each on their own page
- Settings can be found from Obsidian's settings search
- The TaskNotes page shows how many statuses and priorities differ before importing
- A setting that depends on another one is unavailable until that one is turned on
- Add buttons in the table, Gantt, project editor, and settings share one quiet style
- Remove buttons in the task editor, project editor, and settings are icon buttons with tooltips
- The import dialog uses Obsidian's native buttons
- The Gantt zoom control uses Obsidian's native buttons
- Filter and saved-view buttons match Obsidian's native buttons, with an accent tint when active
- The cursor lands where a task description was clicked when the editor opens
- Subtasks are archived and unarchived along with their parent task

- A completed subtask is crossed out in the task editor
- The field for adding a subtask lines up with the subtasks above it
- Tasks listed under Depends on and Blocks open in the task editor when clicked

- A timeline row saying a task depends on something outside the view opens those tasks when clicked
- A subtask in the task editor opens in its own editor when clicked
- A subtask is renamed in its own editor rather than by typing in the subtasks list

### Fixed

- Due dates read a day early on the board, the table, the project list, and a project overview for anyone whose clock is behind UTC
- A status or priority with an icon showed none of it in the filter dropdowns and the bulk action bar
- A project icon picked from the icon grid showed its name as text in the project list, the toolbar, the overview, the project settings, and the project picker
- Clearing a number custom field wrote an invalid value into the task's note
- A custom field holding a link showed as raw link text in the table
- A person custom field showed the stored text in the table instead of that person's avatar
- A person custom field lost the link to the person's note when set in the task editor
- A checkbox custom field showed true or false in the table
- A url custom field was plain text in the table
- The assignees on a project's overview did not open their notes when clicked
- An assignee whose name is a link showed as raw link text in the assignee filter, the bulk assign menu, the timeline tooltip, and the task editor
- The assignee filter skipped tasks that wrote the same person's name a different way
- Two people with the same name were treated as one by the assignee filter, when each had their own note
- A task title sat above the middle of its row when another column made the row taller

## [1.6.3] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- The project view was empty when Pane Relief or Hover Editor was enabled ([#80](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/80))

## [1.6.2] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- Task note filenames keep more of the task title before shortening

### Fixed

- Subtasks added in the task editor were lost on reload ([#90](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/90))
- The app froze when duplicating a task with a long title
- The project list showed stale task counts until the view was reopened ([#121](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/121))

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-15

### Changed

- Task and project modals follow Obsidian's native border, shadow, and corner styling

- An assignee written as a note link (`[[People/Jane Doe]]`) showed the link path on its avatar instead of the person's name ([#64](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/64))

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- Saving a task updates only the affected task notes instead of every note in the project
- Projects open faster, and reopening a project is instant. Edits made outside the plugin are still detected and reloaded
- The table stays responsive in large projects
- Views update in place after an edit, keeping the scroll position and selection
- Select all in the table selects every task matching the current filter, not just the visible rows

- Progress bar labels showed 0% instead of the actual value in some views
- The subtasks toggle did not respond in the Gantt view

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Setting "Save tasks on close" (default on). When off, closing the task modal by X or click-outside discards edits, so only the Save button keeps them ([#62](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/62))
- "Open as note" button in the task modal header opens the task's note in a new tab
- Pasting a screenshot or dragging a file onto the task description saves it to the vault attachments folder and embeds it at the cursor
- Search box, filters (status, priority, assignee, tag, due date, archived), and saved views appear above every view, not just the table
- Filter state persists per project across plugin reloads
- Saved views remember the view mode they were created in, and selecting one switches the project to that mode
- Gantt lifts a matching task to the top level when its parent is filtered out, so search reveals deeply nested matches
- Release artifacts carry GitHub build provenance attestations; `gh attestation verify <file> --owner StepanKropachev` confirms a download was built from this repo

### Changed

- The UI follows the Obsidian theme: accent color, near and overdue colors, badges, and avatars
- Toolbar, Gantt, filter, and bulk-action buttons render at Obsidian's native size
- Saved-view tabs match the styling of the filter pills

- Status and priority badges in the task modal are no longer keyboard-focusable
- The delete confirmation uses Obsidian's native warning style
- Primary buttons in light theme use a solid accent fill
- The project header gear, bulk-action clear, remove, and table row buttons use Obsidian's icons
- Remove buttons on tags, assignees, and dependencies turn red on hover
- Project-card and kanban-card progress bars are 3px tall
- The filter row collapses when no filters are active, and the Filter pill expands it
- Toggling a filter pill no longer moves focus out of the search box
- Gantt milestone labels and dependency arrows follow the active filter
- View switcher buttons show only an icon
- Assignee avatar initials use the first letter of the first two words, so "Michael Jordan" shows "MJ" instead of "MI"
- New task notes are named after the task title. Existing notes keep their name until the task is renamed

### Removed

- The Gantt "Hide completed" button; the Status filter excludes Done and Cancelled instead, and existing settings migrate automatically
- The inline quick-add input above the table; the toolbar "add task" button opens the task modal instead

### Fixed

- A solo avatar had extra spacing on its right in the project edit modal
- Kanban cards dropped the fourth and later assignees
- Duplicate task entries appeared when creating a task
- A saved-view pill stayed highlighted after its filter was changed
- An assignee stored as a wiki link (`[[Wiki Link]]`) showed garbled avatar initials ([#64](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/64))
- Renaming a task to a title already used by another note shows an inline error instead of failing silently

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Duplicate task action in the table and Kanban context menus
- "Open current file as project" command

### Fixed

- "Today" rolled over in the evening west of UTC

### Fixed

- `file://` links in task descriptions did not open on click

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- Dependency-based auto-scheduling
- Type `[[` in the description field to link vault notes
- Markdown preview in task descriptions, with a toggle between edit and rendered

### Fixed

- Dependent tasks lost a day on each reschedule
- The Gantt scroll position was lost on re-render
- The import modal wrote tasks to the wrong folder
- Subtasks did not render when added through the parent task modal
- Deleting dependent tasks crashed the plugin
- The task modal jumped while typing long descriptions
